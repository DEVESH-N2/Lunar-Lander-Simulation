Deep Q-Learning - Lunar Lander
This notebook focuses on training an agent using Deep Q-Learning to safely land a lunar lander on the moon's surface.

Outline
Importing necessary packages.
Setting hyperparameters.
Understanding the Lunar Lander environment.
Loading and interacting with the Gym environment.
Implementing Deep Q-Learning with Experience Replay.
Training the agent and observing its performance.
Conclusion and references.
The environment involves discrete actions and an 8-dimensional observation space. Rewards are based on proximity to the landing pad and velocity, among other factors.

The agent is trained using a Deep Q-Network (DQN) with a target network and experience replay to stabilize learning.

This summary captures the key components and objectives of the notebook without delving into specific implementation details.

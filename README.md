# Deep Q-Learning - Lunar Lander

Welcome to the Deep Q-Learning Lunar Lander project! This notebook aims to train an intelligent agent to safely land a lunar lander on the moon's surface using reinforcement learning techniques.

## Outline

- **Importing Necessary Packages:** Essential libraries are imported to support the development and execution of the project.
  
- **Setting Hyperparameters:** Fine-tuning of parameters crucial for optimizing the Deep Q-Learning algorithm.
  
- **Understanding the Lunar Lander Environment:** Exploration of the lunar lander environment provided by OpenAI's Gym, which involves discrete actions and an 8-dimensional observation space.
  
- **Loading and Interacting with the Gym Environment:** Steps to load the environment and interact with it using reinforcement learning methods.
  
- **Implementing Deep Q-Learning with Experience Replay:** Introduction of Deep Q-Network (DQN) architecture with enhancements such as experience replay to improve training stability.
  
- **Training the Agent and Observing Its Performance:** Training process of the agent to master the task of landing the lunar lander while monitoring its performance metrics.
  
- **Conclusion and References:** Summarization of results and pointers to further readings and resources used in the project.

The agent's learning is facilitated through a Deep Q-Network (DQN), utilizing a target network and experience replay for efficient and stable training. Rewards are intricately tied to the proximity to the landing pad and velocity, ensuring the agent learns to navigate and land safely.

Explore this project to witness how Deep Q-Learning can empower an agent to conquer the challenges of lunar landing!
